## File Date Stamper

Takes a filename, adds a datestamp to it and moves it to another folder.

## Using

```
python3 datestamp.py -in filename -out file directory
```

### Example
```
python3 -in log.txt -out file test
```

This will spit out a file called `log-20210320.txt` in the `test` directory.
